                    <h2>history with Realmadrid (2009-2018)</h2>
                    <p>In 2009, Ronaldo transferred to Real Madrid for a then world record £80 million.[89] At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli.[90]

                        Ronaldo made his La Liga debut against Deportivo La Coruña on 29 August, scoring a penalty in a 3–2 home win.[91] He scored in each of his first four league games, the first Madrid player to do so.[92] His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against Zürich.[93] His strong start to the season was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty, which kept him sidelined for seven weeks.[94][95] Despite scoring 33 goals in all competitions and contributing to Real Madrid's 96 points in La Liga, his first season with Madrid ended trophyless.[96]</p>

                    <p>Ronaldo joined Juventus in 2018 for €100 million, the transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old and the highest paid by an Italian club.[140] Upon signing, Ronaldo cited his need for a new challenge as his rationale for departing Madrid,[141] but later attributed the transfer to the lack of support he felt was shown by club president Florentino Pérez.[142]On 1 October, he reached several milestones in Juventus's 3–0 Champions League group stage win over Bayer Leverkusen including breaking Iker Casillas' record for most Champions League wins of all time.[151] On 18 December, Ronaldo leapt to a height of 8 ft 5 in (2.57 m), higher than the crossbar, to head the winning goal in a 2–1 away win against Sampdoria.[152] He scored his first Serie A hat-trick on 6 January 2020, in a 4–0 home win against Cagliari and became only the second player to score hat-tricks in the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A.[153] On 22 February, Ronaldo scored for a record-equal.</p>

                    <p>At the age of 18, Ronaldo made his debut for Portugal as a substitute against Kazakhstan on 20 August 2003.[202] At UEFA Euro 2004, he scored his first international goal in a 2–1 group stage loss to Greece in his eighth international appearance.[203][204] Despite Portugal losing to Greece again in the final, Ronaldo made the team of the tournament, with two assists and two goals.[205] In the 2006 FIFA World Cup, at the age of 21 years and 132 days, Ronaldo became the youngest ever goalscorer for Portugal at a World Cup finals.[206] Portugal reached the semi-finals, where Portugal lost to France, with Ronaldo being booed during their defeat, due to an incident that occurred in the quarter-finals against England.[207] FIFA's Technical Study Group overlooked him for the tournament's Best Young Player award and handed it to Germany's Lukas Podolski, citing his behaviour as a factor in the decision.[208][209]</p>
